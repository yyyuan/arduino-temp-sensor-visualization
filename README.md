# arduino-temp-sensor-visualization
This is a small temeperature visualization written for visualize the data from arduino. 

## Arduino Setup
Simply use the file inside the arduinoTempSensorSetup folder to setup arduino for reading temperature correctly.
Changes needed if using different temeperature sensor, and different duration for reading data.

## Running Visualization
Simply connect Arduino board to the laptop and open the Processing file in tempVis folder!
